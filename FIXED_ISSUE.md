# GitHub Pages Deployment Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ

## What Was the Problem?

Your website at https://pranayk07.github.io/FlowIQ/ was showing a blank white screen because:

1. **Missing basename configuration**: React Router's `BrowserRouter` wasn't configured to handle the `/FlowIQ/` subpath that GitHub Pages uses for project sites
2. **No SPA fallback**: GitHub Pages doesn't natively support client-side routing, so any direct navigation or page refresh would fail

## What Was Fixed?

### 1. Added basename to BrowserRouter (`src/App.tsx`)
```tsx
<BrowserRouter basename={import.meta.env.BASE_URL}>
```
This tells React Router to handle routes relative to `/FlowIQ/` in production.

### 2. Created 404.html fallback (`public/404.html`)
This file catches all "404 Not Found" errors and redirects them to index.html with the route encoded in the query string. This is a standard solution for SPAs on GitHub Pages.

### 3. Added redirect handler to index.html
A small script that decodes the route from the query string and restores the correct URL using `history.replaceState`, so React Router can handle it properly.

### 4. Updated DEPLOYMENT.md
Added clear instructions on how to access the site and troubleshoot common issues.

## How to Access Your Site

### ‚úÖ Correct URL:
```
https://pranayk07.github.io/FlowIQ/
```
**Note**: Include the trailing slash `/` after `FlowIQ/`

### ‚è≥ Wait for Deployment
After this PR is merged to `main`:
1. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site
2. This takes about 2-5 minutes
3. Check the Actions tab at https://github.com/PranayK07/FlowIQ/actions to monitor progress

### üîç If You Still See a Blank Screen
1. **Clear your browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Cmd+Shift+Delete)
2. **Try incognito/private browsing mode**
3. **Hard refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Wait for deployment to complete** (check GitHub Actions tab)
5. **Verify the URL** has the trailing slash

## How It Works

```
User visits: https://pranayk07.github.io/FlowIQ/dashboard
             ‚Üì
GitHub Pages: "404 Not Found - this file doesn't exist"
             ‚Üì
GitHub Pages serves: 404.html
             ‚Üì
404.html redirects to: index.html?/dashboard
             ‚Üì
index.html script: Converts ?/dashboard back to /FlowIQ/dashboard
             ‚Üì
React Router: Loads the Dashboard component
             ‚Üì
User sees: Dashboard page! üéâ
```

## Testing Locally

To test the production build locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then visit http://localhost:4173/FlowIQ/ in your browser.

## Summary

The changes are minimal and surgical:
- ‚úÖ 1 line changed in `src/App.tsx` (added basename)
- ‚úÖ 1 new file `public/404.html` (SPA fallback)
- ‚úÖ 25 lines added to `index.html` (redirect handler)
- ‚úÖ Updated `DEPLOYMENT.md` with instructions

All changes follow best practices for deploying React SPAs to GitHub Pages!
